Goals: regular expressions, character functions in R, and web scraping.

In this assignment, we‚Äôre going to scrape the 2018-2019 Brooklyn Nets Regular Season Schedule (they‚Äôre a basketball team from Brooklyn that plays in the NBA). We will take the regular season schedule from http://www.espn.com/ and reassemble the game listings in an R data frame for computational use.

To do this, perform the following tasks:

<ol>
<li>Open the link http://www.espn.com/nba/team/schedule/_/name/BKN/seasontype/ 2. Save the page as NetsSchedule1819 using a .html extension. Once the file is saved, check that you can open the file by a text editor or import it in R.</li>
<li>Use the readLines() command we studied in class to load the NetsSchedule1819.html file into a character vector in R. Call the vector nets1819.
a. How many lines are in the NetsSchedule1819.html file? b. What is the total number of characters in the file?

c. What is the maximum number of characters in a single line of the file?
</li>
<li>Open the webpage. You should see a table listing all the games scheduled for the 2018- 2019 NBA season. There are a total of 82 regular season games scheduled. Who and when are they playing first? Who and when are they playing last?</li>
<li>Open NetsSchedule1819.html using your browser and again look at its source code. What line in the file holds information about the game of the regular season (date, time, opponent)? It may be helpful to use CTRL-F or COMMAND-F here and also work between the file in R and in the text editor.</li>
</ol>
Using NetsSchedule1718.html we‚Äôd like to extract the following variables: the date, the game time (ET), the opponent, and whether the game is home or away. Looking at the file in the text editor, locate each of these variables. For the next part of the homework we use regular expressions to extract this information.

<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<ol start="5">
<li>Write a regular expression to extract the line that contains the time, location, and opponent of all games.</li>
<li>Write a regular expression to split the whole line into 82 lines, with each line displaying the information of one game. (You may obtain some hint from problem (vii).)</li>
<li>Write a regular expression that will capture the date of the game. Then using the grep() function find the lines in the file that correspond to the games. Make sure that grep() finds 82 lines, and the first and last locations grep() finds match the first and last games you found in (ii).</li>
<li>Using the expression you wrote in (vii) along with the functions regexpr() and regmatches(), extract the dates from the text file. Store this information in a vector called date to save to use below. HINT: We did something like this in class.</li>
<li>Use the same strategy as in (vii) and (viii) to create a time vector that stores the time of the game.</li>
<li>We would now like to gather information about whether the game is home or away. This information is indicated in the schedule by either an ‚Äò@‚Äô or a ‚Äòvs‚Äô in front of the opponent. If the Nets are playing ‚Äò@‚Äô their opponent‚Äôs court, the game is away. If the Nets are playing ‚Äòvs‚Äô the opponent, the game is at home.
Capture this information using a regular expression. You may want to use the HTML code around these values to guide your search. Then extract this information and use it to create a vector called home which takes the value 1 if the game is played at home or 0 if it is away.

HINT: In my solution, I use the fact that in each line, the string &lt;div class=\‚Äùflex items-center opponent-logo\‚Äù&gt;&lt;span class=\‚Äùpr2\‚Äù&gt; appears before this infor- mation. So my regular expression searches for that string followed by ‚Äò@‚Äô or that string followed by ‚Äòvs‚Äô. After I‚Äôve extracted these strings, I use substring() to finally extract just the ‚Äò@‚Äô or the ‚Äòvs‚Äô.
</li>
<li>Finally we would like to find the opponent, again capture this information using a regular expression. Extract these values and save them to a vector called opponent. Again, to write your regular expression you may want to use the HTML code around the names to guide your search.</li>
<li>Construct a data frame of the four variables in the following order: date, time, opponent, home. Print the frame from rows 1 to 10 Does the data match the first 10 games as seen from the web browser?
